# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my academic and professional portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**.  
This repository documents my journey in learning how modern data science tools can be used to enhance, test, and extend traditional economic analysis.

## 📘 About This Portfolio

This repository contains my coursework, labs, and applied projects for ECON 3916.  
The goal of the course — and of this portfolio — is to **bridge economic theory with modern machine learning**.

In economics, we care about **causal relationships**:  
> What happens to wages if education increases?  
> How does inflation respond to monetary policy?

In data science, we care about **prediction**:  
> How accurately can we forecast prices, income, or demand?

This portfolio reflects my training in combining both perspectives. I am learning to use:
- **Causal inference** from econometrics  
- **Predictive modeling** from machine learning  

together to build models that are both **interpretable** and **powerful**.

Using the course’s **Concept Extension** philosophy, I start with classical tools such as regression and hypothesis testing, and then scale them up using modern methods like **regularization, cross-validation, and machine learning algorithms**.

## 🎯 Career Focus

I am an undergraduate economics student seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, or Finance**.  
This portfolio is designed to demonstrate my ability to:
- Work with real-world datasets  
- Build statistically sound models  
- Apply machine learning to economic questions  
- Communicate results clearly and rigorously
